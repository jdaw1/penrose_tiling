# Penrose Tilings #

A Penrose tiling is a beautiful thing, of which [the&nbsp;author](https://jdawiseman.com/author.html) is very fond. 
It is an aperiodic tiling, made from two rhombi with tight corners of 72&deg; and 36&deg;. 
Behold!

This repository is all the code needed to make a physical Penrose tiling, whether the size of a room or of a grand outdoor space.

It has a C program, which outputs machine-readable JSON, and also output data in several displayable(ish) formats. 
There are also various examples of such output, and some that have been changed to show the map of my kitchen.

Please, I want to see a physical Penrose tiling in which paths are coloured by length. 
It would make a fantastic public place, a city town square, of a hectare or few. 
If you can, do, and tell me.
